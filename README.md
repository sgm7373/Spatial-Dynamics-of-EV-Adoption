# Spatial Dynamics of EV Adoption 🚗🌎

A spatial analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption trends across Oregon using Tableau visualizations. The project highlights regional disparities, infrastructure gaps, and socioeconomic factors influencing EV adoption using interactive maps and dashboards.

## 📊 Overview

This project builds upon prior analyses of EV registration data and investigates the **spatial dynamics** behind adoption patterns in Oregon. It leverages geospatial data, policy impact timelines, and infrastructure records to visualize how and where EV adoption is growing—and where challenges remain.

## 🔍 Goals

- Understand geographic disparities in EV adoption
- Correlate EV registrations with infrastructure availability and income levels
- Highlight areas needing targeted policy or investment

## 🗺️ Visualizations

| Technique         | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Choropleth Maps  | Show intensity of EV registrations by county using color gradients      |
| Dot Density Maps | Represent individual EV registrations to spot dense clusters            |
| Bubble Maps      | Visualize EV adoption magnitude spatially with circle sizes             |
| Treemaps         | Display proportions of total EVs by region in a compact format          |
| Network Graphs   | Show relationships and connectivity between counties                    |
| Multi-view Dashboards | Combine multiple views for coordinated, interactive exploration   |

## 📈 Tools Used

- **Tableau** for data visualizations  
- **Excel/CSV** for EV registration datasets  
- **Geospatial overlays** for socioeconomic and infrastructure data  

## 📬 Key Insights

- Urban counties like **Multnomah** dominate adoption due to better infrastructure and awareness  
- Lower-income regions show significantly reduced EV uptake  
- Infrastructure gaps and policy effectiveness vary widely by region
